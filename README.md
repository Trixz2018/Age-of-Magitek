# Age of Megitek
magic-tech progression modpack

This modpack is a inspiration of age of engineering, Infinity Expert mode, and Forever Stranded. Instead of just a tech progression tree, there is a magic progression tree as well and sometimes you will find yourself using both magic and tech to progress through each tree. 

This pack is not for the casual player, but more towards a player looking for a challenge like no others before. It will test you in more ways than any other modpack has ever done.
